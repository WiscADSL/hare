# HARE

The project HARE contains two systems:

- [HopperKV](https://github.com/WiscADSL/hopperkv.git): a multi-tenant key-value store that extends Redis to cache data from DynamoDB.
- BunnyFS: a high-performance semi-microkernel filesystem for NVMe SSDs.

Please refer to the README of each for more details.
